# Pima-analysis-using-Logistic-Regression
This is the analysis of Pima Indian Dataset from Kaggle using the Logistic regression 
In this analysis we have done tha accuracy calculation of the dataset and the Implementation anlong with 
The Cross validation of the dataset to get more optimised output of accuracy. The data PObservation is also Included to geta a prime View on the case
